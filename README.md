## Machine learning prediction of postoperative complications after high tibial osteotomy for canine cranial cruciate ligament disease
**Overview**
* This repository contains the code and trained XGBoost model for the <b><u>PROSPECT</u></b> (<b><u>P</u></b>redicting <b><u>R</u></b>isk <b><u>O</u></b>f <b><u>S</u></b>urgical com<b><u>P</u></b>lications aft<b><u>E</u></b>r <b><u>C</u></b>CWO and T<b><u>P</u></b>LO)
 model.
* Publication pending.

**Model**

* The XGBoost classifier was trained on the dataset with Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to predict postoperative ambulation recovery.
* Best XGBoost hyperparameters: {'learning_rate': 0.16,'max_depth': 3, 'n_estimators': 400,
'subsample': 0.80, 'colsample_bytree': 0.92}
